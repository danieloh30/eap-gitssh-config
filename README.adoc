# Using SSH credentials to connect to a remote Git SSH repository

With JBoss EAP 7.4, you can use SSH credentials to connect to a remote Git SSH repository. This repository can manage your server configuration data, properties files, and deployments.

You must use the elytron configuration file to specify SSH credentials. You can then start your standalone server instance and have a remote Git SSH repository manage your server configuration file history.

If necessary, you can generate SSH keys by using one of the following methods:

* The elytron-tool.sh script
* The OpenSSH command line
*
